## What this project gives you

A complete worked example of offline-first packaging with a cryptographic audit
chain: source pinned at `c15708a04d3d28e9a1cd50553c456299dbc6d236`, a 16-check assurance suite, an evidence register
with per-check hashes, and an AIOSS ledger chain ending at `9cdf26b12c42579fb31733909f35b3563f73f6c468ee7c6dac4d920afcfb38e2`.

## Learn by verifying

```
python tools/run_bench.py --out BENCH.json
```

Then take any row from `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md`, recompute
the SHA3-256 of its evidence file, and confirm it matches. If it does not match,
the record has been altered — that is the whole point of the chain.
